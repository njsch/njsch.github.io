  <h2>Acknowledgement of Country</h2>
  <p>The curator of this website has resided and lived on premises resting on the lands of: either the Kwat Kwat or Pangerang clans of the <a href="https://yynac.com.au/">Yorta Yorta</a> nation; the various indigenous/Aboriginal peoples of Wodonga; and the <a href="https://www.wurundjeri.com.au/">Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung clans of the Kulin Nation</a> respectively.
  <br/>
  In the spirit of reconciliation, the owner, creator and maintainer of this site acknowledges the original inhabitants of Country throughout Australia and First Nations peoples' stewardship of the land, sea and community. I pay my respect to their Elders (past, present and emerging), extending that respect to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples today As we continue to learn to live together on these ancestral lands.</p>
  <p>Note: if you want to use your own acknowledgement of country, it is probably best to consult a government website that will contain up-to-date information on what is the best wording to use. At a base level, here are the <a href="https://www.indigenous.gov.au/contact-us/welcome_acknowledgement-country">Federal</a> and <a href="https://www.firstpeoplesrelations.vic.gov.au/acknowledgement-traditional-owners">Victorian state</a> Government recommendations.</p>
