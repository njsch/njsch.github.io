Contained below are resources, mainly for blind and vision impaired audiences, on use of hardware and software audio equipment.

* [Steve Baskis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevebaskis/) has some great resources on his [blog](https://www.stevebaskis.com/b360-access/) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/baskis360) on using [Avid](https://www.avid.com/about-avid)'s industry-standard [Pro Tools](https://www.avid.com/pro-tools) on a Mac with VoiceOver and other audio production/engineering topics.
* [Slau Halatyn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/slau-halatyn-2b623944/) has created a guide for using Pro Tools with VoiceOver on [MacOS](https://www.britannica.com/technology/macOS) called [PTAccess](https://ptaccess.github.io). It is extremely comprehensive and well worth the read.
* [Byron and Phyllis Harden](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iseemusicllc/)'s [ISeeMusic](https://iseemusic.com/about/about-us/) has a wealth of resources on recording and mixing with software and hardware technology solutions. The courses rquire fees but they run sessions where they hire very experienced, professional trainers who walk you through the course, according to very client-centred approaches to accessibility, tailored to your own professional needs, or those of any academic institutions you may study at, if any..
