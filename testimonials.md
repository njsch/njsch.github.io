## What inspires you?
> At a recent workplace meeting I was asked ‘What inspires you?’. Reflecting on this question; it is the perseverance, grit & determination of students with vision impairment that inspires me in my workplace.
Almost a decade ago I was introduced to Maxima, Computer Algebra System (CAS) calculator software, by a Victorian Yr.12 brailling student. The following year, I briefly sat in on a session where the said student introduced Maxima to Nathaniel Schmidt, who also wanted to operate a CAS calculator independently in Yr.12.
I was unsure whether Nathaniel would have the support needed to successfully follow this path. His story inspired me. When I decided that the ‘EduVis Pat Roberts Accessible Calculator Benefit’ would include materials to support students operating accessible calculators independently, I contacted Nathaniel for his input.
