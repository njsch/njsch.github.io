Contained on this page are some resources I have collated, partly for myself as it makes it easier to access them but also in the hope that others may find them useful.

## Bible Reading Materials
### Read the Bible in Self-interchangeable Lists Through Grant Horner's Bible-reading System
Say goodbye to Bible reading plans! Click [here](/horner-ten-lists/) to find out more.

### Audio Bibles
* Purchase solar-powered [audio Bibles through Megavoice](https://megavoice.com/audio-bible/) (their global site can be found [here](https://megavoice.com) and they have an [Australian website](https://megavoice.org.au) as well)

## Statements and Confessions of Faith
### The 2nd London Baptist Confession of Faith (2LBCF or 1689LBC)
This document was penned in 1677 by Reformed and Calvinistic Baptists in England; however, owing to religious freedom legal restrictions, the confessional document was not more formally, officially published until 1689, after the restrictions had been lifted. You can either view it below or [here](/2lbcf/) in a separate link.

#### An Alternative Reading
[Brandon Crawford](https://prts.edu/profile/brandon-crawford/) has written an interesting book, articulating a rendition of the 2LBCF (confession and catechism) for dispensational readers. Check it out [here](https://www.amazon.com/Baptist-Confession-Catechism-Dispensational-Churches/dp/1649603878).

## Hermeneutics
### Resources on Christotelic Hermeneutics
[What is the Christotelic Hermeneutic and Why Should You Care?](https://christthetelos.wordpress.com/2014/09/26/what-is-the-christotelic-hermeneutic-and-why-should-you-care/)

## Systematic Theology
### Eschatology and Covenantalism
* [Progressive Dispensationalism](https://www.amazon.com.au/Progressive-Dispensationalism-Craig-Blaising/dp/0801022436): a fantastic book I would recommend to anyone wanting to look further into [the theological bridge-building process](https://www.gotquestions.org/progressive-dispensationalism.html) between classical and revised forms of Dispensationalism with Covenant Theology.

## Historical Theology
* G. Allison's &ldquo;[Historical Theology](https://www.amazon.com.au/Historical-Theology-Introduction-Christian-Systematic/dp/0310230136)&rdquo;:


## Allegories
### Narnia
Okay, one must note that [C. S. Lewis](https://www.cslewis.com/uk/about-cs-lewis/) of all people would probably be the first person to say that he should not be idolised or unhealthily revered. It's not the Bible, but although they were [already regarded as classics with typological value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_The_Chronicles_of_Narnia), [Michael Ward](https://michaelward.net)'s [Planet Narnia](http://www.planetnarnia.com/) provides some fascinating insights, hypothesising that there is certainly something to be said for what was clearly a very intricate mind that put &ldquo;[The Chronicles of Narnia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Narnia)&rdquo; together, standing the test of time even in spite of opposition from its critics. You should definitely check it out. The podcast episode &ldquo;[Lewis' Narnia](https://undeceptions.com/podcast/lewis-narnia/)&rdquo; from Undeceptions With [John Dickson](http://www.johndickson.org) provides a good overview of some of the concepts.

## Resources for Blind and Vision (visually) Impaired Audiences
### Social and Health Aid to Developing Countries and Those in Need
* Christian Blind Mission is the primary organisation known to be involved with this sort of work. Among other websites, here are their [global](https://www.cbm.org), [Australian](https://www.cbm.org.au) and [United States](https://www.cbmus.org) ones.

### Book Libraries
* [Optasia Ministry's Optasia Library](http://www.optasiaministry.org/library.htm)
* [Grant Metcalf](http://bartimaeus.us/grantbio.html)'s [Bartimaeus Alliance of the Blind](http://bartimaeus.us/grantbio.html)
* [Tim Snyder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-snyder-a8a4a634/)'s [BrailleAudio](https://brailleaudio.org/member/index.php), an affiliate of [Spoken Word Ministries](http://spokenwordministries.org)

### Biblical Language Resources
* Again, [Grant Metcalf](http://bartimaeus.us/grantbio.html)'s [Bartimaeus Alliance of the Blind](http://bartimaeus.us/grantbio.html)
* Prof. [Sarah 'Blake' Larose](https://www.sarahblakelarose.com) has some good resources on accessible Biblical language access and transcription. She has a Ph.D. in Biblical Hebrew. There is another individual from the U.S., namely Dr. Ray McAllister, who also used to have some resources available on a website; but I can't find it any more.
